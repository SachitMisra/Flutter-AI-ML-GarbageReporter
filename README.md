# AI/ML Based Garbage Reporter (Smart India Hackathon Project)

A flutter mobile application for reporting garbage, potholes and stray cattle.
The user clicks a picture of either of the above problems and if detected, the problem is reported and further action can be taken by authorities.

The application sends the picture over the server which runs a trained model on python to detect the image.
